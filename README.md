# Aircraft-Performance-Calculator
First aerospace-focused Python project built with Jupyter Notebook
# 🛩️ Aircraft Performance Calculator (Python + Jupyter)

This project calculates core aircraft performance metrics based on user inputs and standard aerospace engineering principles. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, it models flight characteristics such as range, endurance, climb rate, and fuel consumption.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🔢 Calculate performance metrics:
  - **Range**
  - **Endurance**
  - **Fuel consumption**
  - **Climb performance**
- 🧍‍♂️ Let users define:
  - Aircraft **weight**
  - **Wing area**
  - **Engine thrust**

## 🚀 Aerospace Concepts Applied

### ✈️ Basic Aerodynamics
Understand how air flows over surfaces and how lift, drag, and thrust interact with gravity.

### 🌀 Four Forces of Flight
- **Lift**: Upward force from air over wings  
- **Weight**: Gravitational pull  
- **Thrust**: Forward propulsion from engines  
- **Drag**: Air resistance opposing motion

### 📈 Aircraft Performance Parameters
Learn how key variables affect flight behavior — including glide slope, thrust-to-weight ratio, and rate of climb.

### ⚙️ Propulsion Systems
Model how thrust and engine performance relate to aircraft motion and fuel usage.

### 🌡️ Atmospheric Conditions
Account for changes in temperature, air density, and altitude on flight dynamics.
